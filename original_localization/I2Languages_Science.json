    "Science/TechNodes/Descriptions/tNode_1v_rockets_01": "With radial decouplers, we will be able to attach fuel tanks and engines to the sides of our craft, then discard them once they're empty, significantly increasing the thrust and range of our vessels. Pretty cool, huh?",
    "Science/TechNodes/Descriptions/tNode_1v_rockets_02": "A solid rocket booster, or SRB, is a powerful engine with fuel already built in. They are quite useful for providing a huge amount of thrust during the start of a launch, particularly with 2 or more radially attached. Because more power equals more fun, right?",
    "Science/TechNodes/Descriptions/tNode_1v_rockets_03": "With this technology we will explore advances in Specific Impulse, or ISP. Engines with high specific impulse are not always as powerful as lower ISP engines, but are more efficient and consume less fuel, making them quite useful in low gravity environments like space. ",

    "Science/TechNodes/Descriptions/tNode_1v_rover": "When it’s time to explore the surface of a planet, a rover is a Kerbalnaut’s best friend. These wheeled vehicles can be designed for any and all types of conditions and make traveling to alien terrains both convenient and fun.",
    "Science/TechNodes/Descriptions/tNode_1v_science_01": "With the environment scanner module equipped, your vessel will be able to gather more detailed reports from all over the Kerbollar system, which will translate to even more delicious blue science points for every fascinating new location you discover and explore.",

    "Science/TechNodes/Descriptions/tNode_1v_utility_02": "Ways to escape when things go horribly wrong.",
    "Science/TechNodes/Descriptions/tNode_1v_xenon": "Ion powered engines are a breakthrough technology. They have very little thrust, but the specific impulse is unparalleled, making them extremely useful for small exploration probes. They also emit a beautiful blue glow, so what’s not to like?",
    "Science/TechNodes/Descriptions/tNode_2v_aero_01": "A faster engine and a way to slow down before landing? What a treat!",
    "Science/TechNodes/Descriptions/tNode_2v_aero_02": "It's surprising how fast these parts can make your craft look!",

    "Science/TechNodes/Descriptions/tNode_2v_electronics_02": "Powerful antenna and some batteries to keep them running.",
    "Science/TechNodes/Descriptions/tNode_2v_hydrogen": "The Nuclear Engine for Rocket Vehicles, or NERV is a very efficient new type of engine. Even more exciting is that the NERV uses hydrogen for fuel, which has significantly less mass than methalox, making it quite useful for deep space missions. Ignore the green glow, it’s perfectly safe.",
    "Science/TechNodes/Descriptions/tNode_2v_payload": "All sorts of parts to carry other parts and even some hitchhikers!",

    "Science/TechNodes/Descriptions/tNode_2v_science_03": "It is important that we develop a large-scale science lab for our space program. Think of how much science we can learn if we could study individual regions on a planet or moon from low orbit! That should be well worth the cost in snacks.",
