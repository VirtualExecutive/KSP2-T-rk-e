It could easily be manufactured by anyone, but everyone loves WinterOwl, so it’s never been copied.",
    "Parts/Description/tailsection_1v_tapered_rightcone": "The Slanted Tail Connector B offers an option for aircraft tail assemblies. Or if you want a really, really long nose on your aircraft. It’s your craft, build it like you want.",
    "Parts/Description/truss_0v_square_1x1": "The ST-XS-1 is a tiny square truss measuring 0.625 meters in length. Rumor is it became known as the “Boxy Delight” after an engineer accidentally welded themselves inside one during assembly.",
    "Parts/Description/truss_0v_square_1x1_0-31m": "The ST-Micro-1 is a square micro-truss measuring 0.3125 meters in length. It is affectionately known as the “Tinker-truss” among several prominent construction companies.",
    "Parts/Description/truss_0v_square_1x4": "The ST-XS-4 is a tiny square truss measuring 2.5 meters in length. It is extremely useful for smaller craft. While it may look like a ladder, this is assuredly not a ladder and Bob's Girders is not responsible for ladder-based usage.",

    "Parts/Description/truss_3v_circular_1x1": "The CT-L-1 is a large circular truss measuring 3.75 meters in length. Marketing has coined this truss “Circle Me Around,” but we’re not sure why.",
    "Parts/Description/truss_3v_circular_1x4": "The CT-L-4 is a large circular truss measuring 15 meters in length. It was supposed to be a 1.5-meter circular stage truss, but one of the engineers read the blueprint wrong, and hundreds were manufacturered before the mistake was caught.",
    "Parts/Description/truss_3v_saddle_1x1": "The LST-S is a second-generation saddle truss. Not only is it designed to hold and discard whatever cargo you want to carry, it is also designed with even more tubes that the MST series!",
    "Parts/Description/truss_3v_saddle_1x4": "The LST-L saddle truss, lightweight and strong, is perfect for long voyages. It can hold whatever you like for as long as you like, so what's not to like?",

    "Parts/Description/truss_4v_circular_1x1": "The CT-XL-1 is a huge circular truss measuring 5 meters in length. Oddly, no one has proposed a nickname.",
    "Parts/Description/truss_4v_circular_1x4": "The CT-XL-4 is a huge circular truss measuring 20 meters in length. This truss is so big it’s been dubbed the “Circulator.” We told marketing that this would be confusing, but never argue with Bob.",
    "Parts/Description/truss_4v_saddle_1x1": "It might look like just a framework, but the HST-S is one of the most reliable saddle trusses available. R&D assures us that according to their new tubmatics formula, it has the shiniest tubes available.",
    "Parts/Description/truss_4v_saddle_1x4": "When Tubular Tubes first proposed the HST-L saddle, engineers wondered who would use such a monstrosity. When one was used to transport tons of emergency snacks to a colony on the Mun, it became huge success, even starring in an upcoming action movie!",
    "Parts/Description/truss_4v_square_1x1": "The ST-XL-1 is a huge square truss measuring 5 meters in length. It is so huge and square that it’s been granted no less than 4 honorable mentions from the Kerbal Cubist society.",
    "Parts/Description/truss_4v_square_1x4": "The ST-XL-4 is a huge square truss measuring 20 meters in length. This truss is so big it could be the frame for a skyscraper. No, we did not steal this from an actual skyscraper.",
    "Parts/Description/tube_0v_procedural": "The TOOB-000 may seem small, but it is both lightweight and strong, and so much cooler than a truss. (Don’t tell the folks at Bob’s Girders we said that)",
    "Parts/Description/tube_1v_procedural": "The TOOB-125 was one of the first tubes Tubular Tubes manufactured and continues to be one of the best-selling TOOB tubes on the market. Because TOOB tubes are the coolest tubes to be. (Apologies, marketing made us say that.)",
    "Parts/Description/tube_2v_procedural": "The TOOB-250 is designed for all your tubular construction needs. Because everyone knows a ship is much cooler when it has TOOB tubes.",
    "Parts/Description/tube_3v_procedural": "When it comes to structural tubes, the TOOB-375 is one of the most tubular tubes available. Lightweight, strong, and oh, so cool, it is guaranteed to make any construction project look better.",
    "Parts/Description/tube_4v_procedural": "Everyone knows a tube is lighter, stronger and much cooler than a cylinder, and the TOOB-500 is a perfect example. By far one of the most popular TOOB tubes in Tubular Tube’s tube inventory.",
    "Parts/Description/wheel_0v_rover": "The S2 rover wheel is the smallest in Kerbal Motion’s inventory. Lightweight and strong, the S2 was designed for exploration vehicles, but it works well for smaller one- or two-seat rovers. Just don’t try any fancy maneuvers.",
    "Parts/Description/wheel_1v_rover": "The RoveMax M1 is the perfect balance of both strength and style. Whether you’re designing a sophisticated exploration craft or building a giant skateboard, this medium-sized rover wheel is an excellent choice to keep on rollin'.",
    "Parts/Description/wheel_2v_rover_ruggedized": "Using the latest ruggedizing technology, the engineers at Kerbal Motion developed the ultra-rugged TR-2L “Ruggedized” rover wheel. This medium rover wheel is so tough and rugged we just can’t say it enough. For the best in off-world off-road fun, go with the TR-2L.",
    "Parts/Description/wheel_2v_truck": "When you need to haul large amounts of cargo or passengers, look to the RoveMax TR4 truck wheels. Designed for the cruelest terrain, the TR4 is large enough to crush smaller rovers in their tracks. Please, don’t crush any small rovers. Our stockholders hate that.",
    "Parts/Description/wheel_3v_rover": "The RoveMax XL3 motorized rover wheels are the largest and heaviest rover wheels available. Rumors that they were so huge the Kerbal Motion CEO had a heart attack when he first saw them are greatly exaggerated. Truth be told, he only fainted. Twice.",
